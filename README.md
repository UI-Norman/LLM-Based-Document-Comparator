# LLM-Based-Document-Comparator

## Overview

AI Document Comparator is a web-based application built with Streamlit and powered by Google Gemini AI (via the `google-generativeai` library). It enables users to upload two documents‚Äîan original and a revised version‚Äîand perform an intelligent comparison. The tool analyzes differences in content, structure, images, and more, providing detailed metrics, AI-generated insights, executive summaries, recommendations, and downloadable reports in multiple formats (TXT, PDF, DOCX, JSON).

Key technologies:
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for an interactive UI.
- **AI Backend**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash model for natural language analysis and structured output parsing (using LangChain and Pydantic).
- **File Handling**: PyPDF2 for PDFs, python-docx for Word files, PyMuPDF (fitz) for advanced PDF processing, PIL and pytesseract for image/OCR handling.
- **Reporting**: ReportLab for PDF generation, python-docx for DOCX, and built-in libraries for TXT/JSON.

## Features

- **Document Upload**: Drag-and-drop or browse to upload original and revised documents (supports PDF, DOCX, TXT, JSON).
- **AI-Powered Comparison**: Analyzes text differences, structural changes, image variations, and semantic impacts using Gemini AI.
- **Metrics Table**: Displays quantitative metrics like similarity score, length changes, word additions/deletions, and more.
- **AI Analysis Sections**:
  - Executive Summary.
  - Section-by-Section Analysis.
  - Image Comparison Report.
  - Recommendations Summary.
- **Document Previews**: Side-by-side text previews of original and revised content.
- **Downloadable Reports**: Generate and download comparison reports in TXT, PDF, DOCX, or JSON formats.
- **Error Handling**: Robust validation for file types, API key presence, and processing errors.

## Installation

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-document-comparator.git
   cd ai-document-comparator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The `requirements.txt` includes:
   - streamlit>=1.28.0
   - google-generativeai>=0.8.0
   - PyPDF2==3.0.1
   - python-docx==0.8.11
   - python-dotenv==1.0.0
   - Additional implicit dependencies (e.g., reportlab, pymupdf, Pillow, pytesseract, langchain-core, pydantic) ‚Äì ensure they are installed if not covered.

   **Note**: For OCR/image processing (using pytesseract), install Tesseract OCR on your system:
     - On Ubuntu: `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`
     - On macOS: `brew install tesseract`
     - On Windows: Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) and add to PATH.

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Gemini API key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app1.py
   ```
   This launches the app in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

2. **Using the App**:
   - **Upload Documents**: In the sidebar, upload the original and revised files. Supported formats: PDF, DOCX, TXT, JSON.
   - **Compare**: Click the "üîç COMPARE DOCUMENTS" button. The app will process the files, extract text/images, compute metrics, and use AI for in-depth analysis.
   - **View Results**:
     - Metrics Table: Quantitative overview.
     - AI Comparison Table: Structured changes with details on section, original/revised content, change type, impact, and recommendations.
     - AI Analysis: Detailed summaries with highlighted keywords.
     - Previews: Side-by-side text views.
   - **Download Reports**: Use the buttons to download reports in your preferred format.

## Configuration

- **API Key**: Required for Gemini AI; set in `.env`.
- **Custom Prompts**: The app uses LangChain prompts for AI analysis‚Äîmodify in `app1.py` (e.g., `comparison_prompt`) for custom behavior.
- **UI Customization**: CSS styles are embedded in `app1.py`; adjust for themes or layouts.
- **File Limits**: No explicit size limits, but large files may increase processing time‚Äîhandle via Streamlit config if needed.

## Limitations

- **File Formats**: Limited to text-extractable PDFs (scanned images require OCR, which may be inaccurate).
- **API Dependency**: Requires a valid Gemini API key; rate limits may apply.
- **Image Comparison**: Relies on OCR for text in images; visual differences are described qualitatively via AI.
- **Performance**: For very large documents, processing may be slow‚Äîoptimize by chunking text if needed.
- **No Real-Time Collaboration**: Single-user app; extend with Streamlit sharing for multi-user.

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Error**: Ensure `.env` is loaded and the key is valid. Check Streamlit console for "GEMINI_API_KEY not found".
- **File Reading Issues**: Verify file integrity and format. For PDFs, ensure they are not password-protected.
- **AI Analysis Failures**: If the model returns empty results, check prompt templates or increase retry logic in code.
- **OCR Errors**: Install Tesseract correctly and ensure language packs if non-English.
- **Streamlit Issues**: Run with `--server.port=8501` if port conflicts occur.

For persistent issues, check Streamlit logs or open an issue on the repository.
